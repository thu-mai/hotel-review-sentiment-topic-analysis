Sentiment Analysis and Topic Analysis on Trip Advisor Hotel Reviews

## 1. Introduction

This project uses a dataset of about 515,000 hotels’ reviews in Europe from Kaggle. The sufficiently large dataset would provide a more comprehensive analysis on the reviews of hotels across the different geographies in Europe. Within the dataset, there are critical information such as hotel names, addresses, nationality of the guests and most importantly the hotels’ reviews. In addition, the reviews provided by the guests were categorized under positive and negative comments. This would provide the ideal dataset for us to perform text analysis on the reviews to obtain further insights.
